# training-models-to-make-me-rich
This project is a Python script that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the closing price of a stock for the next day. The script pulls historical stock data from the Alpha Vantage API and uses six different regression models to generate the prediction.

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone 
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Replace the symbol, start_date, and end_date variables in the script with your desired stock symbol and date range.
Run the script

Usage
Once the script is running, it will print out the R-squared score of the prediction as well as the predicted closing price for the next day based on the historical data.
